Sudoku Validity Checker
=======================

### About

Built at a hack night, takes coordinates on a sudoku board and an input number with the format "row:column input". Unless the input number violates any of the rules of sudoku ([how to play sudoku](http://www.sudoku.name/rules/)), it added to the board. If it breaks any rules, the number is not added and it outputs "Invalid"

### Installation
